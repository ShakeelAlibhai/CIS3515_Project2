### SignUpForm App - Shakeel Alibhai

This is a simple Android application that contains four text fields, each with a corresponding TextView label:
* Name
* Email
* Password
* Password Confirmation

Users can fill in the four fields and then click a button that says "Save". (Note that the data is not actually saved in ROM.) 
If any of the fields are not filled out, a toast notification will be displayed telling the user that all the fields should be filled.
If the two password fields do not match, a similar toast notification will be shown, informing the user of the error. 
If all the fields are filled in properly, then a "welcome" toast notification will be displayed.
